    "storyline": "You just signed on with PAH Inc. Paranormal Activity Helpers Incorporated, yeah sounds corny, but the pay is great. They said you won't ever be in any real danger, and they have tons of work right now. Your first job is at some old haunted house. There is a broker wanting to put the house for sale, but with everyone in the town spreading rumors of evil living inside the house, he needs some proof that it is safe. He actually seems creeped out himself. Anyway, he hired PAH Inc. to check the place out. You can go check it out alone if you'd like, but I would take at least 3 more friends with me. Check the place out, and if there is anything supernatural going on, try to bring evidence back to PAH Inc.",
    "summary": "An indie, multiplayer, horror game with fast paced game play for up to 4 players. Teams will need to explore an eerie mansion with a rumored past of funeral services including contacting deceased loved ones. A scary girl roams the house, and players need to keep her pacified to survive.",
